0-1 Knapsack Problem
====================

In the 0â€“1 Knapsack problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value,
and we need to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the
total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

    Dynamic-Programing based solution do the 0-1 Knapsack problem.

    KS is a matrix of dimensions (n_items + 1) x (capacity + 1)
    KS[i, j] = max value of items 0..i-1 with capacity limit of j
    to calculate KS[i, j] we have two options:
        1. don't add item i-1 to the knapsack ->
           the maximum value is the maximum value without i but with the same capacity limit (KS[i-1, j])
        2. add item i-1 to the knapsack ->
           the maximum value is the value of item i-1 + the maximum value of items 0..i-1 with capacity limit of j-w
    KS[w, v][0..j] = max
            k[i-1, j] (don't add item j),
